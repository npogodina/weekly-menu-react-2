[Weekly Menu](https://master.dgrpdkkvvvjff.amplifyapp.com/) is a serverless web app that allows registered users to add dishes and makes a weekly menu out of them. The dishes can have optional ingredients. If the ingredients are provided, the app will output a grocery list in addition to the menu. This helps planning meals and making grocery lists.

Weekly menu started as a capstone project for Ada Developers Academy by Nataliya Pogodina.

[Ada Developers Academy](https://adadevelopersacademy.org/) is a non-profit tuition-free intensive coding school for women and gender diverse people. It combines six months of classroom training with a five month internship at Seattle tech companies. As a culmination of the classroom learning experience, students create a Capstone project where they are encouraged to learn and implement new technologies with a three week deadline.
